This flag allows users to customize the diamond command by providing a string of preferred diamond option. For example, if the user would like to change the identity threshold to 95 % for alignments and add the flag '--fast', the user would input the following when running sieve: 
--user_diamond_options '-f 100 --unal 0 --id 95 -e 1e-6 --fast'.

This is a part of an if statement that checks if the number of observed alignment from diamond analysis is not greater than the specified threshold (diamond_min_align_reads). If this condition is true, it means that there are not enough alignments, and then the file will be removed and the sample will be deleted for the rest of the pipeline.

---------------------

``-with-singulairty`` (default: ``sieve.sif``)

To simply specify the Singularity image file from where the containers are started. Every time your script launches a process execution, Nextflow will run it into a Singulairty container created by using the specified image. 

.. WARNING::

   The sieve.sif created for the pipeline is define in the Nextflow configuration file. 

``-resume``

Specigy when restarting the pipeline. Nextflow will use cached results from any pipeline steps where inputs are the same, continuing from where it got to previously. 

You can also supply a run name to resume a specific run: ``-resume [run-name]``. Use the ``nextflow log`` command to show previous run names.
